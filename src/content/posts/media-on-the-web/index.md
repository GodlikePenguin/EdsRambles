It's really true, there is a website for everything, and whilst some are incredibly niche, there are others than can provide value to almost everyone. It's just a case of knowing they exist. This is the first post in a series aiming to take a look at websites that you might not have heard of, but I think you could gain some value from.

## [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/)

As their tagline says: **Track**. **Discover**. **Share**. Trakt is a website that you can use to track your viewing habits across film and TV, rate the things you like, and discover new media to watch. Whilst Trakt is by no means the only site which can track your viewing progress, in my opinion it's the most fully featured, and has great integrations with other services like [Infuse](https://firecore.com/infuse), [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/) and the [\*Arr](https://wiki.servarr.com/) suite.

## [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/)

JustWatch tells you what streaming services a show or movie is currently available on. There are two scenarios I have found this most useful in:

1. Finding out what streaming app I have to open to watch a particular item, rather than searching each app individually
2. When watching a movie with friends on [Teleparty](https://www.teleparty.com/) you can use JustWatch to find something you want to watch on a streaming service you all have access to

Furthermore, you can tell JustWatch what streaming services you have, and then search through all the content that are available on these services, essentially becoming a search aggregator for all your streaming services. No more scrolling through one service looking for something to watch, now you can aimlessly scroll through the JustWatch webpage instead!

## [AfterCredits](http://aftercredits.com/)

<ImageFade src="/src/content/posts/media-on-the-web/aftercredits.com-1366x768.png" />

This site says whether a movie has an end credits scene or not, and if there are multiple scenes it says whether they're pre, during or post the main credits. Users can vote on whether they think the scene is worth staying around to watch, and if you don't care about spoilers, you can also see a text summary of what happens. This is essential for watching your next Marvel film in the cinema.

## [TuneFind](https://www.tunefind.com/)

<ImageFade src="/src/content/posts/media-on-the-web/tunefind.com-1366x768.png" />

Ever been watching a show or movie and wanted to know what that song you just heard was? This has become much easier in the age of streaming services and Shazam, but for the occasions those aren't enough you can use TuneFind. This site crowd-sources the songs that appear in film and TV, allowing users to suggest the songs that play at a particular timestamp, and vote on whether suggestions by other users are correct. It also provides links to streaming services so you can listen to the full versions of songs you're interested in. Neat if you remember a song was played in an episode but don't want to watch the whole thing again just to find one song.

## [WornOnTV](https://wornontv.net/)

A similar idea to TuneFind but this time for clothes worn by characters in movies and shows. Can't say I've personally used it, but it's definitely a neat idea.
