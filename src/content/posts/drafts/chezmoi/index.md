I've always been aware of dotfile managers, but I've never really been invested enough to put the time into using one. That is until recently I've got a new work laptop, as well as a new personal laptop, meaning I've had a lot of setup to do and wanted to minimise the duplicated effort. [Chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/) is a dotfiles manager with a powerful templating engine, scripting capabilities, and all backed by a Github repo.
